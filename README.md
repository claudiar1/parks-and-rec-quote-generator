# Parks and Rec Quote Generator

This is my first project as part of the Treehouse Full Stack JavaScript TechDegree program.

When the user clicks the "Show another quote" button, a randomly selected quote from the show Parks & Recreation Renders.

I aimed for "Exceeds Expectations" in my completion of this, meaning that in addition to the basic program requirements I added some additionally specified features, including the use of setInterval() to render a new quote to the page every 20 seconds (following the user's initial click of the button) and the random generation of an rgb color that is assigned to the body's background with each new quote.
